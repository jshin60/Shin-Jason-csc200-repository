368990	There is very interesting reading at wikipedia about this topic. For a "standard" game of Klondike (of the form: Draw 3, Re-Deal Infinite, Win 52) the number of solvable games (assuming all cards are known) is between 82-91.5%.
1772773	find / -name "*.iso" which will find (starting in /) all files that end in .iso You may want to add 2>/dev/null if there are many directories you don't have read access to & don't want many permission denied errors amongst the output.
1894655	It all depends on how much data you're transferring, and how fast you want it done :-) if you need to transfer/stream 1gb+ files often (think file servers, streaming media servers, high load SQL databases, etc.) ... then yeah, it's a big difference
2390620	Lots of great answers, but one variable not mentioned is whether you are riding alone or with others. The effects of drafting is significant. I'm at least 2 mph faster riding with others since I can spend much of the time in their wake.
1260731	In Bash, to view the current directory in Windows File Explorer just enter: explorer.exe . Don't leave out the ".". This will open windows explorer at the current folder and you can see where everything is in relation to the rest of your Windows system.
1338379	Passing 1000V at 10A through a diode does not generate 10kW of power. The power dissipated by the diode would be the forward voltage drop times the current. Only the voltage dropped by the diode counts toward power dissipated.
1262548	In I2 you should write this array formula (enter it using Ctrl+Shift+Enter): =INDEX($C$2:$C$9,MATCH(1,($G2=$A$2:$A$9)*(H2=$B$2:$B$9),0)) Then you can copy it to other columns (K, M, O).
2144998	No, it means that the person has a friend request in their account and they have not yet accepted it. If you click on "Cancel", then that will remove the friend request from their account, and Facebook would give you the option to send another friend request.
2185393	Also be aware of brown widows -- like black widows, but you know, brown. Same distinctive round abdomen. Spiky white eggsacs. Around here (San Diego) they are in every dang crevice -- especially empty pots or under the lips of plastic ones.
27179	Nope is an informal variant of one of the meanings No which is: 3 : not so —used to express negation, dissent, denial, or refusal (e.g. no, I'm not going) Webster-Merriam That is why, we can only use it for Yes/No questions.
58194	Consider it a (very) brief form of a construction like this: (You can have one for three dollars, or) two for five. That's just the use that has come to be idiomatic. There's no real reason why one is more popular than the other.
148944	If you are asking for an orthographic -s/-es: there are many examples, e.g. miss, floss, fuss, kiss, ... If it's about a phonetic [(ɪ)s]/[(ɪ)z], there are even moe: e.g. rise, impose; sneeze, snooze, freeze, ...
1237165	Using WSL bash console, in your home directory, create a file with an arbitrary specific name such as "test_here.txt". Then using Windows Explorer, using the search box, search for the file test_here.txt. On the found file > right-click > Open file location.
1838985	Try running rsop.msc (Resultant Set of Policy) on the machine in question and browse to Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings and check to see if there is a domain policy overriding the local settings regarding screen savers / idle time / etc. thanks, mark
1185931	Just created small bash script which will print table with fingerprints for all key ciphers allowed on server (according to /etc/ssh/sshd_config) in both SSH-256 and MD5 algo.

1631366	Just boot from Windows DVD and do a Startup repair. On most of the systems repeatedly pressing F10 key brings up the boot menu. Give it a try. A hiberated partition cannot be mounted. You have hibernated Windows 8 instead of shutting it down.
376702	Community Chest is named from the original Atlantic City version of Monopoly. In Atlantic City, the Community Chest was a welfare organisation. Therefore, Community Chest cards are more likely than not to give money. On the other hand, Chance cards are more likely to move you to a random 'chance' location.
665957	When you include the squared term, the unsquared term represents the slope when x=0, which is probably not what you want. It is usually better to test sequentially. That is, don't include the squared term in the model when you are assessing the linear component.
1894657	Depends on how many people are using this connection and what they're doing. At its peak, 1gb will obviously be able to handle 10 times as much traffic than 100mb. If you're transferring a lot of data between servers often, then, yes, you will notice a difference.
2134254	In Trello, card titles are single line, i.e. they can't contain a carriage return. (It's similar to the subject line of an email) If you'd like to include multi-line content, you can do that in the card description, or in a comment (using shift + enter)
2141689	If you use an instant messaging client application, such as Trillian, Pidgin, Digsby etc., you can set them up to be able to chat over Facebook too, and those programs have settings that let you play a specific notification sound when a particular friend comes online.
2382958	4 minutes sounds about right. It depends, of course, on how fast you ride and whether you have any delays such as traffic lights or road crossings. For that short a distance, you'll probably spend more time getting ready to ride and locking up your bike at the station restaurant.
916330	When you log off, your session is ended, i.e. any programs you were running and your desktop, etc. and you return to the welcome screen. The PC still on, and there are system-level applications and services running. When you shut down, everything stops running and the PC is powered off.
1893271	It's good stuff, though on a network your size it probably doesn't get you a whole lot. The best thing it does for you is tell you which machines need updates, which going with the standard Windows Update won't. That by itself is a useful view into your network.
2194268	Yes, compost needs water but not too much. It should have the same amount of dampness as a wrung out sponge. And it needs to be tilled and turned over every once in a while to keep it aerated; that will help prevent mildew from forming.
1163136	Explanation : When you use your HDMI Port your graphic card is solicitation much more than normal if the laptop is not cooling properly it could result in extreme overheat. Solution : You need to open your laptop to clean it from dirt and replace it's cooling pate.
1275304	With the current Windows 10 Insider (Fast ring: Windows 10 build 19025.1) you can mount your distro as a network drive. WSL is accessible as wsl$, the path is your distribution name (wsl -l -q). For example net use Z: \\wsl$\Debian /PERSISTENT:YES
949819	It's not the smartest way to share files, but on Ubuntu you can simply use Share Folder option in the context menu, set settings as you wish and thats all. (Relogin may be required.) Then on MAC Ubuntu share should be discoverable.
1645122	At a simple level, dpkg checks to see if dependencies/conflicts are met, extracts the files from the .deb file, runs any {pre,post}{inst,rm} scripts (whichever are applicable), and adds a record that the package is installed into its records (which is just a file, I think).
2283120	Not what you asked, but for safety the most important thing, even more important IMO than getting the right rise and run, is that every step is consistent. Varying as little as 1/4 inch in rise will make even a ballerina fall on her face if she's running up the stairs.
1671768	GShutdown is a utility which allows you to schedule the shutdown or restart of your computer. With it you can simply and quickly choose the turn off time at either a specific time or after a countdown. Install Gshutdown: sudo apt-get install gshutdown source.
2178527	Perhaps not regularly, but certainly whenever the heap begins to look a little dry - successful composting depends on moisture. There is a very good article on composting and moisture level, together with a host of useful links, here, and an excellent one on home composting, by the Royal Horticultural Society, here.
400030	First Watcher is the title of the head citizen of Falme. The title originates from the Watchers over the Waves, and the job of watching for the Return, but over time the people have forgotten about that and just use First Watcher as a title. That's what they're being punished for.
908908	I can't find exactly what SSD that is, but it's a variant of a standard called Mini PCI-E or PCI Express Mini. As detailed here, you need the specific type used by the Eee, of which this is a good example. A guide to upgrading to it can be found here.
1934356	Add an authoritative zone for some.thing.com, and create an A record for @ (windows DNS calls this "(same as parent folder)") pointing to the internal address. Requests for other records under thing.com will be forwarded or recursively looked up, as the server will only be authoritative for the some.thing.com zone.
2228256	My experience with compact stoves for butane/propane mixture: Amazingly efficient when it is warm outside. Super for camping in the summer and early autumn. But in the late autumn, when the temperature starts to creep below 5 deg C: Not so efficient anymore. Alcohol stoves have fallen out of favour in Norway.
27149	I think there is a subtle difference between emphatic and dismissive or terminal. And I think that nope is often used in the latter two ways. Think of how the lips must close together and this gives nope its terminal feeling in a physical way. Pursed lips. Can't pry them open. Not going to change.
52428	I think the context has a lot to do with how the word Nope is perceived: Somebody asks you for something. - Will you do something for me?- Nope. << Rude Somebody asks for information. - Is your name Sam?- Nope. << Playful / informal Maybe the word Nope implies a casual, relaxed attitude, which in some cases may come off as dismissive.
58200	For whatever reason, when using the "X for Y" idiom, the thing that you (as a consumer) gets is usually specified first. I think it's because the longer form of the phrase would be something like "Get (or perhaps 'have') X in exchange for Y". In this case, "get 2 burgers in exchange for 5 dollars".
896888	Run Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. You can get it here. You may be able to remove it with that. If not then format and reload is the quickest, easist way to clean out the system. Besides a good reload every now and again keeps the OS running well. Hope that helps.
1051677	I have developed a solution which allows you to have a scrolling desktop on Windows. It's complete freeware and there are multiple ways to enhance your desktop. Infinite_Screen at http://ynea.futureware.at The standard is pressing Ctrl+ (moving mouse to the edges) or CtrlShift+ (mouse move) and four others.
1096154	We repair televisions that have had their HDMI IC's damaged by 'Hot Plugging'. Either the software has been corrupted, or the actual IC damaged, causing the HDMI input not to work. It seems to be a risk as the plug/sockets wear. Best not to take a risk, and switch off before inserting.
908695	The computer restarted for some reason. And when it logged in again Windows detected that your profile was damage and used a temporary profile instead. This can happen, I'm not sure why. But as long as you got the right profile after a reboot there should not be any problem. Maybe someone else has a more detailed explanation.
560285	Double bonds are stronger than single bonds and they are characterized by the sharing of four or six electrons between atoms, respectively. Double bonds are comprised of sigma bonds between hybridized orbitals, and pi bonds between unhybridized p orbitals. Double bonds offer added stability to compounds, and restrict any rotation around the bond axis.
997337	In some contexts, the term "name server" can refer to servers that aren't part of the Internet Domain Name System. For example, a WINS server is a name server for Microsoft's legacy proprietary networking protocols. There may have been other legacy LAN systems that had their own types of name servers that weren't part of Internet DNS.
2283858	The Stairway Manufacturing Code Association published the International Residential Code (PDF Link) in 2006 which tells you just about everything you could ever want to know about stairs, including: minimum headroom depth (6' 8") minimum tread depth (10") maximum rise (7.75") maximum tread depth variability (3/8") maximum rise variability (3/8") maximum slope of riser (30°)
397703	Well, the book does say the crew planned to go back to him in 36 years, which I assume is the time needed for him to age backwards to how old he was when it all began. And he was 61 years old when he had the heart attack, so that would fit if he was 25 years old when it started.
2283124	It not so much about the rise and run lengths specifically ,but about the ratio of the Rise to Run. You should strive to hit a 30-35% ration of rise/run. A 7-11 is the most common and gives you the correct ratio, but any combination of rise to run that hits this 30-35% ratio would be fine.
2372671	Here's an article with average speeds for various different cases. When doing longer than 100km distances, I find it useful to guide by heart rate not speed. Pick a sustainable heart rate and stick to it, regardless of momentary or average speed. In long distances, if it's not racing with tactics and all, it is important to go steady.
1250567	For 3.5 Inch Desktop Hard Drives the power cable and the SATA cable are separate cables. Every recent power supply should come with a few SATA power plugs. If you don't have enough free plugs, or if your power supply is really old, there are adapters. For data you just need a normal SATA cable.
1680933	I had the same issue, yesterday I connected my laptop to the TV and I had to select HDMI Audio output in the Sound Settings menu for having the sound working on TV. This morning I had the HDMI disconnected and the only thing that I had to do for fixing the issue is double clicking in the default audio interface.
1716940	In the output of free, Free memory is the amount of memory which is currently not used for anything. This number should be small, because memory which is not used is simply wasted. Available memory is the amount of memory which is available for allocation to a new process or to existing processes. The example given in the question shows a healthy system.
73546	In the United States, one can go to court to establish a conservatorship for the person. A conservator or guardian is appointed by the court, and acts to protect the person's financial and other interests. The role of a conservator has similarities to the role of the executor of an estate.
88565	The meaning of "from" and "of" are slightly different. We say "made of a substance" (made of rubber). But we say "made from something already made for some other purpose" (made from rubber tires). For example "made of glass", but "made from old Coke bottles". Or "made of paper", but "made from old magazines". These are only general trends in meaning, and not strict rules.
500868	I actually had to do a quick google on "bridge camera" - but I'd say the differences are rather obvious: Bridge Camera = high end point and shoot better optics than a compact camera larger sensor than a compact camera DSLR: bigger sensor exchangeable lenses (key) optical viewfinder where you look through the lens (via a mirror -> SLR = Single Lens Reflex) (key)
1674252	If you want to parse your downloaded HTML files, you can filter them through something like html2text (you have to install the package 'html2text'). This might be helpful if you want to get rid of the formatting in the .html documents, however, parsing the original .html or the new .txt files is pretty much the same thing.
1234798	For me the fix was (right click on Kmplayer) "Main Controls" -> "Audio" -> "Audio Renderer" and set it to "Default Device". I had headphones selected as the device to be used and it only played audio for the first instance and the rest had no sound, but when I set 'Audio Renderer' to 'default device' I had audio for multiple instances again.
1358547	Search for wafer switches. They are rotary switches, which used to be available (update : still are!) as pre-built configurations, or in modular form with up to 12 ways on each wafer and as many wafers as you felt like stacking behind the switch body. A 4-pole 3-way switch is a single wafer, one of the simpler standard configurations.
1266894	Your motherboard only supports "standard" SATA connections - i.e: it doesn't have an mSATA or M.2 socket on it. The Samsung 860 EVO comes in one of three form factors: 2.5" mSATA M.2 As your motherboard doesn't support anything other than "standard" SATA, you should purchase the 2.5" model, and connect it accordingly.
2295954	As a general rule your stairs should be built with this in mind and you won't bust code no matter where you live. 2 risers plus 1 tread must equal a minimum of 24" and a maximum of 25" when added together. Example ( 2 risers of 7-1/4" = 14-1/2" then your tread could be 9-1/2" to 10-1/2").
432767	I just researched this. While I don't know if its true, I have found references that claim that in the comics he ran 13 trillion times the speed of light. For reference, the speed of light converts to 186,282 miles per second. In the TV show, he runs a little over mach 2 which is 0.426261 miles per second (according to google).
1042980	They are different things - The Command Prompt is Not MS-DOS - but as far as the user is concerned they could be the same thing as they do the same things. So it depends on your point of view. From a technical point of view your friend it correct, but from a user perspective you are correct (sort of as there are differences that an expert would spot).
1152285	This could also be caused by your motherboard and/or BIOS configuration. This article explains step-by-step how to check if your motherboard USB "jumpers" are enabled, and how to enable the wake up event in your BIOS. It's specific to an MSI motherboard, but the principle is basically the same no matter what kind of hardware you have.
2380371	You can easily test if your light is too bright. Leave it on your bike and see how it looks. Nowadays there are lots of too bright LED flashlights and headlamps the market that were not designed for cycling. Problem is they flood the light to very wide angle. I would recommend a light made for cycling that has different modes for different use cases.
48873	It's an idiomatic expression that means the same thing as "given this information" or "from this point of view". Example: The young man came from extreme poverty where no one in his family had even graduated high school much less university. In this regard, the fact that he was able to get his PhD. in Mathematics before the age of 22 was nothing short of extraordinary.
2154637	Add something like the following If by "first sheet" you mean one specific sheet no matter the sheets order if(ss1.getSheetName() == 'Sheet1'){ //do something like set date } or If by "first sheet" you mean that the sheets' order matters if(SpreadsheetApp.getSheets()[0].getSheetName() === ss1.getSheetName()){ //do something like set date }
51646	Actually I think "misstep" is probably the best word to use (without additional details about the circumstances). In life we face many decisions, and the choice is to move forward (step) in one direction or another. The wrong choice becomes the "misstep", and the right one could be "a step in the right direction". After many disappointments, they finally took a step in the right direction.
437042	According to the official Marvel power-grid for Spiderman, he is classed as "super-human" (placing him in a category with those able to lift between 800lbs and 25 tons). Although his raw strength is portrayed pretty inconsistently in the comics (including feats of lifting up to 40+ tons), he's usually expected to be able to lift somewhere between 10-20 tons with relative ease.
509137	It's all about the lens. Looking at the cameras which are called a bridge camera, the first thing you will notice is the big honking lens on the thing, I think the rest of the features can be compared with point and shoots but not this one. That's its most distinguishing feature whether or not it makes it compare to an SLR is a matter of opinion.
2056655	You can't. As in the link provided by AgDude: From Nov 5, 2014: Unfortunately there isn't a Cloudwatch Metric for the current IOPS Credit balance like there is with the CPU credits but I am definitely submitting a feature request through to our EBS/Cloudwatch teams for such a metric. Up to now, Nov 2, 2015, this feature was not implemented yet.
2247936	A major second interval consists of 2 semitones (or as you say a whole step) whereas a minor second interval consists of a semitone. Example of major second is C - D. Example of minor second interval is B - C. " considering that in the natural scales formulae, they are both one whole step ?" this is wrong. Of the second intervals only the major second consists of a whole step.
2411979	I am not suggesting you do this, just giving my experience from replacing airbags. I am not familiar with this vehicle specifically, but I have changed the airbag on a couple older cars (early 90's). In the cars I worked on, the airbags were plugged into the car's wiring harness, I could simply unplug them. This will throw the airbag diagnostic light.
269680	Unless your apocalypse took place in a location with antiquated rail technology (like most of the US) that you're re-using, neither steam nor diesel is a good solution. Your (exitsing, rebuilt) locomotives are electric. You can run them with power generated by hydroelectric dams, which should be easier to restore than building an oil refining or wood/coal supply chain. See for instance the railways in Europe.
376623	The Angel's abilities trigger when it enters or leaves the battlefield. Exile, even for just long enough of one instant's effect, counts as leaving the battlefield, and coming back into play counts as entering it. Any cards previously exiled by the Angel would return to your hand, and a new set of three creatures can be chosen for exile. It's all right there, and it all happens right then.
517948	The STM version is better because it has faster, smoother AF, and the front element does not rotate. The optics are also improved which gives you better image quality. The STM focus ring is active during Auto Focus and you can small manual adjustments to focus. This is called Full Time Manual Focus. The STM version also has a much nicer EW-63C lens hood.
678337	If you only have 2 values, just present those 2 values. It doesn't make sense to convert 2 measurements into 2 other quantities (mean and stdev) if your audience is going to argue about the significance of one or the other. If you want to estimate uncertainty, these other responses are right on, but don't forget to add other potential sources of error (measurement instrument bias errors, resolution, etc.).
1010153	Inbound rules filter traffic passing from the network to the local computer based on the filtering conditions specified in the rule. Conversely, outbound rules filter traffic passing from the local computer to the network based on the filtering conditions specified in the rule. Both inbound and outbound rules can be configured to allow or block traffic as needed. These rules are not useful when firewall is off.
2247932	A minor second is a semi tone closer to the root note than a Major Second. D - Eb is a Minor Second. D to E is a Major second. As a general rule of thumb if you have a Major interval and you bring the notes closer to each other by either raising the bottom note or lowering the top note by a semi tone then you have a minor interval.
368989	Solitaire is a game that precedes its computer version, and that means that all the cards are truly shuffled, without the computer peeking in to verify the game is solvable. And like McKay mentioned, with a random shuffle you can definitely end up with an unsolvable game. I'm sure it is possible to design a Solitaire variant in which each game is solvable, though.
471017	In the Cursed Child, it says Draco and Harry look at each other as friends for the first time. He also stands up for Harry and Hermione in the Cursed Child. Let’s also not forget he apologized to Ginny for messing up her kitchen. Finally, Harry’s son and Draco’s son become best friends. Yeah, Draco definitely turned into a nice person.
1270531	It is just CIDR value. You can learn more in here for CIDR.
